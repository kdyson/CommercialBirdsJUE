## Introduction {#CH3-introduction}

Human actions including development, tree removal, creation of impervious surface, and landscaping choices influence vegetation communities in social-ecological systems [@faeth2011]. Habitat loss and degradation are primary drivers of extinction in anthropogenic habitat [@alberti2005; @polasky2005; @rosenzweig2003]. For conservation efforts to be successful in social-ecological systems, the habitat matrix in which preserves and remnant habitat are situated must provide sufficient resources for local species [@miller2002; @fahrig2001; @fischer2006; @polasky2005; @rosenzweig2003; @shoffner2018]. A better understanding of the relationship between bird communities and the habitat or vegetation outcomes of human action at the parcel-scale can help guide policy and management best practices to improve matrix habitat quality [@goddard2010; @miller2002]. 

How bird habitat use and vegetation association are impacted by development, landscaping, and management actions at the parcel-scale is one important aspect of this relationship. While human actions can control the community composition of flora, habitat selection in mobile fauna like birds results from a hierarchical processes of behavioral responses and differential habitat exploitation to increase survival [@mcgarigal2016; @hutto1985; @chalfoun2007; @faeth2011]. Habitat use is determined by species' habitat selection process and adaptability, the spatial layout of habitat in the landscape, habitat availability and quality, and the local species pool [@cody1985; @muller2013].

Development actions are disturbances, and include removing vegetation and topsoil and compacting soil with heavy equipment, while landscaping actions partly replace succession processes and include choosing and planting tree and shrub species in specified proportions and locations [@grimm2017; @niinemets2008]. The resulting vegetation community composition and structure is an important component of bird habitat quality almost entirely driven by humans [@lepczyk2004; @muller2013; @vanheezik2012; @hamer2008; @nudds1977]. On office developments, this range in habitats is broad, including both properties with few ornamental non-native deciduous trees planted after development and those with second growth native conifer forests preserved through development [@dysonveg2019]. Previous research suggests that bird habitat use is  variably influenced by the resulting vegetation community composition. Native birds frequently prefer to feed in native trees and foliage, and sites with native plantings are more likely to retain native bird species [@paker2014; @chace2006; @belaire2014; @lepczyk2004; @chong2014; @pennington2011]. However, some native bird species are more adaptable and will readily use non-native ornamental vegetation [@belaire2014; @daniels2006]. 

In addition to community composition, the structure of plantings is also important [@macarthur1961; @betts2013; @jones2012; @paker2014]. Bird abundance, and particularly the abundance of leaf-gleaning insectivorous species, is reduced in forest stands where vegetation structure is artificially simplified [@betts2013; @ellis2012]. Heterogenous plant layers are positively correlated with high bird diversity and native forest birds [@beissinger1982; @paker2014; @daniels2006; @chong2014; @smith2015; @cooke2002; @kroll2014; @cooke2002; @evans2009; @melles2003; @pennington2011]. Large lawns and monoculture woods without underbrush are favorable for alien bird species and urban exploiters [@paker2014; @smith2015]. One potential contributing factor to this pattern is that ground cover and increased vegetation structural complexity are frequently associated with increased abundance and diversity of arthropods [@frampton2000]. 

Management actions, including cleanup actions, fertilization and irrigation, and pesticide application can also affect bird habitat use and bird populations in social-ecological systems. Cleanup removes dead wood and other organic matter that may function as refugia and important habitat structures [@linden2013; @hallett2001; @kroll2012]. Birds that are dependent on snags for nesting, roosting, and foraging are unsurprisingly more abundant when these structures are present [@linden2013; @walter2005; @kroll2014; @melles2003; @sandstrom2006]. Nutrient addition through fertilization negatively influences bird species richness [@solomou2014] and may alter bird habitat through changes in primary productivity, vegetation structure (habitat), and food supply i.e. invertebrate abundance [@lepczyk2004]. Irrigation may increase food abundance and cover availability and drive change in bird species composition [@frampton2000; @schleder2010; @defrutos2015]. In urban contexts, higher diversity and abundance is associated with more heavily irrigated land uses, including mesic residential yards in desert ecosystems [@cook2006]. Irrigated urban land uses also have higher vegetation biomass and system productivity, which may drive changes in arthropod communities [@shochat2004; @cook2006; @kirchner1977; @frampton2000]. Pesticides, including insecticides and herbicides, may impact bird populations through direct impacts (toxicity) and indirect impacts including changes in food supply and habitat [@carson1962; @henny1972; @lepczyk2004; @mineau2013; @fry1995; @gibbons2015; @burghardt2009; @hanberry2012; @geiger2010].

However, this previous research frequently focuses on broad neighborhood-scale vegetation patterns instead of the outcome of development, landscaping, and management actions at the parcel-scale. For example, measures of vegetation at a broad scale in bird studies include aggregate vegetation cover and distance between study site and native habitat fragments [@villegas2010]. Vegetation is sometimes quantified indirectly as a function of urban form via urban gradients rather than as a result of developer and property owner actions like tree retention or landscaping [@ramalho2012]. Additionally, researchers frequently conflate multiple management regimes on different parcels by aggregating vegetation information within a buffer around a point count [@lerman2011; @loss2009; @clergeau1998]. 

Results from studies using more aggregation can be difficult to interpret ecologically [@mcdonnell2008; @ramalho2012], and results are of limited use to improve urban biodiversity outcomes through changes in human action [@mcdonnell2013; @ramalho2012]. Studies examining residential parcel-scale decisions and actions find that managed vegetation structure is an important predictor of vertebrate abundance and diversity [@goddard2010; @daniels2006]. These studies provide important management information including specific actions for homeowners to take. 

Here, I expand this research to commercial property. I address three questions concerning bird community composition and foraging on office developments:

1. Which bird species exhibit habitat associations with Native or Ornamental tree and shrub community typologies observed on office developments?
2. What variables describing socio-economic or land cover patterns or variables describing the outcome of development, landscaping, or maintenance actions explain variation in bird effective species richness or bird guild richness?
3. What variables describing socio-economic or land cover patterns or variables describing the outcome of development, landscaping, or maintenance actions explain variation in bird community composition and foraging bird community composition?

As highly mobile species sensitive to variation in vegetation, birds have been used as indicators of biodiversity globally and in urban ecosystems, and patterns of bird habitat use may provide information on the resources available to other trophic levels at an office development [@croci2008; @butchart2010; @blair1999]. Birds are also charismatic, and provide cultural ecosystem services important to large numbers of citizens [@collins2011; @whelan2015; @white2018]. These characteristics make them an ideal study species to examine the impacts of human development, landscaping, and management actions determining vegetation at the parcel-scale on higher trophic organisms.

I compared vegetation communities on office developments with the community composition of birds and the subset of birds engaged foraging behavior (foraging birds) observed on each site during the winter. Winter bird communities are less well studied than breeding bird communities [@jokimaki2003]. Resources obtained during the winter season are critical for survival and impact body condition for migration and reproduction. Thus, the winter season may help shape resident (year-round) bird communities and contribute significantly to population dynamics [@faaborg2010; @manuwal1987; @devries2008; @marra1998]. Bird species' diets are frequently relaxed in the winter, which suggests opportunities for urban vegetation to provide birds with critical food resources [@bnao; @faaborg2010].  

I quantified the bird communities and observed feeding behavior on office developments, collected data on tree, shrub, and ground cover communities, gathered information about parcel- and neighborhood-scale socio-economic and land cover variables, and quantified parcel-scale outcomes of development, landscaping, and management actions. This focus on action outcomes allows me to make development and landscaping suggestions, however developer and land owner motivation is not addressed. I used cluster analysis, regression, and multivariate ecology tools including PERMANOVA to quantify the relationship between bird communities and independent variables.

I hypothesized that bird species on commercial property are associated with the same habitat as observed in non-urban systems [@bnao], and that univariate (effective species richness) and multivariate (community composition) analyses would reveal different patterns. Based on previous research, I hypothesized that top-down neighborhood-scale socio-economic and land cover variables found significant in studies of residential land use types, including median household income, would be significant in explaining variation in effective species richness and community structure [@lerman2011; @luck2013; @melles2003; @schutz2015; @beumer2015; @vanheezik2013]. I also hypothesized that variables describing the outcome of development, landscaping, and management actions impacting vegetation on site would also be significant in explaining variation in the bird community [@belaire2014; @galitsky2015; @daniels2006]. The relative importance of neighborhood-scale "top-down" variables emerging from diffuse decisions in social-ecological systems and parcel-scale "bottom-up" variables resulting from parcel-level decision making varies by location and taxonomic group [@kinzig2005; @belaire2014; @daniels2006; @galitsky2015]. Previous research suggests that for birds in the Puget Trough local factors were twice as important as landscape patterns for frugivores, seed eaters, ground foragers, and bark foragers [@galitsky2015]. Therefore I also hypothesized that parcel-scale variables would be more important in explaining variation in bird communities than neighborhood-scale variables. A local understanding of the relative influence these factors in determining habitat use by birds is an important consideration for urban bird conservation planning and success [@kinzig2005]. 

Broadly, I found that birds are associated with the same habitat on office developments as observed elsewhere. I also found that parcel-scale variables are more important in explaining variation in bird communities than neighborhood-scale variables. Both bird effective species richness and bird community composition on office developments are influenced by parcel-scale development and landscaping actions, including the age and density of native trees and the density of native shrubs on a parcel. These findings suggest an important role for developers, land owners, landscape architects, and tree protection policy in bird conservation, and a need for additional research examining how land use policy is implemented at the parcel-scale, what factors influence developer and landowner actions, and how to best incentivize actions like native conifer preservation associated with more diverse winter bird communities.

(ref:birdconceptual) An overview of the relationships between measured variables and the bird community present at a site. When a site is developed, the developer’s actions determine whether stands of trees are preserved through development, as well as the preserved conifer density, the initial planting design, and the year built. These variables are further modified by the land management actions, including herbicide/pesticide/etc. applications, dead wood removal, and plant replacement. These variables may influence bird community composition in two ways. First, the resulting vegetation on the site influences habitat available to birds. Second, a subset of these variables---such as the socio-economic variables and impervious surfaces---may influence the surrounding bird community and therefore limit the bird community at the neighborhood-scale.


## Methods {#CH3-methods}

### Study area

Redmond (2017 population 64,000) and Bellevue (population 144,000) are located east of Seattle in King County, Washington in the Puget Trough region [@Census2017]. This temperate lowlands region lies between the Cascades and Puget Sound, with post glaciation conifer-dominated forests of Douglas-fir, western red cedar, and western hemlock (_Pseudotsuga menziesii_, _Thuja plicata_, and _Tsuga heterophylla_). Both cities share a similar ecological history including glaciation ending 10,000 years ago, a similar disturbance timeline for logging and agriculture, and have grown considerably since the opening of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (SR 520) in 1963. They are at similar elevations (< 500 ft) and experience the same climate and weather. The two cities are approximately 20 miles from the foothills of the Cascades, and 30 miles from forested mountains > 4,000 ft elevation. Two large lakes, Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish, are adjacent to city borders.

Study sites were selected using disproportionate stratified random sampling across five vegetation strata to ensure that my sample included sites across the entire vegetation gradient [@dysonveg2019]. The sampling frame was limited to Redmond and Bellevue north of I-90 and excluded developments in Bellevue’s central business district. To avoid confounding factors, I restricted the sampling pool to sites in the 25^th^ to 85^th^ percentile for size and the 15^th^ to 85^th^ percentile for surrounding impervious surfaces.

I sent three rounds of mailings to the property owner or manager on file in the King County Assessor's database published October 9th, 2014, requesting access to their property [@dyson2018]. Twenty of the 46 requests sent were accepted, 6 requests were rejected, and 20 received no response or were not deliverable. My final sample included 3-5 sites from each of the five vegetation strata, with `r length(which(all.covariates$DistrictName == "BELLEVUE")) ` sites were located in Bellevue and `r length(which(all.covariates$DistrictName == "REDMOND")) ` of the study sites were located in Redmond. The study sites ranged from `r round(min(all.covariates$acres), 3)` acres to `r round(max(all.covariates$acres), 3)` acres in size. The office developments on study sites were built between 1975 and 2008. Commercial use of the sites included light industrial, white collar office space, medical/dental offices. Some sites were fully leased to tenants, while others were either partly or fully owner-occupied. Company size ranged from one to many thousand employees.

### Bird surveys

I conducted bird surveys between December 12^th^ 2014 and March 1^st^ 2015 and between December 11^th^ 2015 and February 27^th^ 2016. Sampling occurred on days when wind speed was less than 10 mph and rainfall was less than 0.1''. I delayed sampling when there was thick fog in the early morning, however light rain and fog are normal winter conditions. I conducted 40 days of sampling per year comprising four rounds of surveys for each of 20 sites to reduce winter weather bias and characterize bird communities [@marzluff2016causal]. Two sites were visited per day. Sweeps at the first site began at sunrise (approx. 8:00 AM) and sweeps at the second site finished between 10:00AM and 1:00PM due to the variable sampling length and between site transit times. Site visit order was randomized for each round of surveys, and were visited in this order except when scheduling conflicts arose with the property owner or manager. While these scheduling constraints may introduce bias, they are an unavoidable when working on private property [@dyson2018]. 

Birds were surveyed using the standardized search method [@watson2003]. The standardized search method allows for comparison of heterogeneous study sites, retains the parcel as the unit of analysis instead of changing it to the point count circle, and is compatible with the geometry of parcels [@dysonveg2019; @watson2003]. The method encourages observer movement, which allowed for detection of cryptic winter species, observation of bird behavior and foraging activity, and repositioning to mitigate the impacts of urban noise. Pilot data collected using both point count and standardized search methodology confirmed the superiority of the standardized search methodology in detecting birds (Dyson, unpublished data). 

During each site visit, 20-minute sweeps were conducted consecutively until the stopping rule was met, here no new species observed in the sweep. This resulted in `r min(bird.by.visit.PA.info$number.visit.sweeps) `--`r max(bird.by.visit.PA.info$number.visit.sweeps) ` sweeps per visit with a median of `r median(bird.by.visit.PA.info$number.visit.sweeps) ` sweeps per visit. I recorded each bird species along with detection method, whether birds were foraging, and location on site. Foraging activities required visual confirmation except for woodpeckers. I did not estimate abundance or record birds flying overhead, water dependent birds, or raptors, following @melles2003 and @jokimaki1998. Each sweep was recorded using an Olympus WS-822 digital voice recorder. Recordings were used to confirm identifications made in the field and perform quality checks by Bob Sundstrom and myself.


### Bird guilds

I constructed bird guilds based on the Birds of North America Online database and classified bird species based on three factors: diet, foraging substrate, and forest preference [@bnao]. I used three diet categories: insectivore (90%+ insects), grainivore (90%+ seeds), omnivore (mix of insects/invertebrates, fruit, seeds, and other plant parts in various proportions). The three foraging substrate classes were: ground foragers, tree and shrub foragers, or no preference; the no preference group was not analyzed as it contained only 3 bird species. I used three forest preference classes: conifer, mixed conifer/deciduous, and no preference or open habitat preferred. 

I chose these groups based on previous research examining the impact of urbanization on bird trophic guilds. Most studies on feeding guilds focus on diet, including granivores [@chace2006; @blair2008; @werner2009; @zhou2012], omnivores [@lepczyk2004; @jokimaki2003], and insectivores [@blair2008; @zhou2012; @beissinger1982; @chace2006]. Changes in vegetation structure and composition also impact richness of bird guilds defined by foraging method. In urban areas, canopy and bark gleaners are reduced while ground gleaners are more abundant [@beissinger1982; @chace2006].

### Independent variables

#### Detection variables {-}

Potential detection variables include noise levels and weather conditions that can influence the observer's ability to detect birds. Loud noise conditions were recorded in situ and when they consistently interfered with detection, such as leaf blower noise from adjacent property [@leukering1998]. Overcast skies (76-100% cloud cover), fog, and drizzle were also recorded. Hourly data for air temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and solar radiation (brightness) were obtained from AgWeatherNet and the median across time spent at each site calculated [Woodinville sensor; @agweathernet]. 

#### Vegetation data {-}

__Tree Community:__ At each site, individual trees > 4" DBH were identified to species or genus [@symonds1958tree; @dirr2009manual; @dirr1997hardy; @cope2001muenscher; @sibley2009; @city-trees]. Flexible beta clustering and indicator species analysis identified two tree community typologies on office developments, characterized by native and ornamental species. Other variables derived from the tree community include median dominant Douglas-fir height as a proxy for tree age and native conifer density. The presence of stands predating development was determined from historical records [@dysonveg2019].

__Shrub Community:__ At each site, all members of the shrub community were identified to species or genus [@sunset1995; @krussmann1985; @symonds1963shrub; @dirr1997hardy; @dirr2009manual]. Flexible beta clustering and indicator species analysis were used to identify two shrub community typologies, as with the tree community they were characterized by native and ornamental species respectively. Other variables derived from the shrub community include the density of native shrubs and effective species richness of native shrub species [@jost2006]. Tree and shrub genera were assigned to one of three provenance categories---native, non-native, or ambiguous---based on range information from the United States Geological Survey and the United States Department of Agriculture [@USGSplants; @USDAplants]. The ambiguous category was used for genera including both native and non-native cultivated species that are difficult to distinguish, and/or frequently interbred and sold as crosses. 

__Ground Cover:__ Ground cover types were recorded on paper maps, then hand digitized to calculate the area of impervious surfaces on site [@QGIS].

#### Parcel and Neighborhood Variables {-}

I calculated parcel-scale socio-economic variables including site area, year built, building quality, assessed land value per acre, and town, and neighborhood-scale variables including percent impervious within 500 m, median household income, and percent foreign-born based on available databases [@taxDB; @ACS5yr; @KCDB; @xian2011; @homer2015; @dysonveg2019]. 

Neighborhood-scale variables include measures of the built environment and socio-economic context found significant in explaining bird habitat use in previous studies [@villegas2010; @schutz2015; @loss2009; @luck2013; @germaine1998; @hope2003; @kinzig2005; @lerman2011; @melles2005; @munyenyembe1989; @beumer2015; @vanheezik2013]. For neighborhood variables, I chose a 500 m buffer based on previous research and the likely winter foraging ranges of local native bird species [@bnao; @melles2003]. In the study area, this foraging range includes multiple land use types; the commercial properties studied were often adjacent to residential property, and all properties had residential land uses within 500 m. While decisions on in social-ecological systems are driven by a diversity of human agents, and decisions on commercial properties are likely driven by different motivations and considerations than residential property, bird ranges include both types of property and this should be reflected in models. Additionally, including these variables facilitates comparison with results from residential property. 

For birds, canopy cover and canopy height are measures of neighborhood vegetation used in the literature [@beumer2015; @vanheezik2013]. I quantified the percent of tall tree canopy cover and of short and medium height vegetation cover using NAIP and LiDAR data and determined the number of major intersections in a 500 m radius to further measure the habitat matrix in the neighborhood surrounding each site. To calculate vegetation cover measures, I first calculated NDVI from the 2015 NAIP data [@NAIP]. I also calculated object height from 2014 Redmond LiDAR data and 2016 King County LiDAR data by subtracting the digital terrain model from the digital surface model [@RedLiDAR; @KingCoLiDAR]. I classified pixels as tall tree canopy when NDVI $\geq$ 0.15 and object height $\geq$ 50 feet and as short and medium height vegetation when NDVI $\geq$ 0.15 and object height < 50 feet. The percent cover of each was then calculated in a 500 m radius around the parcel boundary. I calculated the number of major intersections by intersecting major road data, checking for accuracy by hand, and then counting the number of intersections within a 500 m radius [@roadsdata].


#### Maintenance data {-}

I interviewed each site's landscaping service using the elite interview technique and supplemented these interviews with observational data from site visits [@dexter1970; @harvey2011]. I then assigned a value (Yes, No, Unknown) to variables based on performance of the following maintenance activities at each site: cleanup (leaf blowing, mowing, etc.), herbicide application, fertilizer application, insecticide application, fungicide application, summer irrigation, mulch application, and mushroom removal. I removed "Insecticide" and "Fungicide" application from further consideration as there were no "Yes" responses. I chose these maintenance variables based on previous research results [@solomou2014; @lepczyk2004; @mineau2013; @gibbons2015; @defrutos2015; @cook2006].

I also censused each site for logs, snags and stumps based on existing knowledge of bird habitat preference [@linden2013; @hallett2001; @kroll2012; @walter2005]. Logs needed to be more than 6" in diameter for inclusion. Snags needed to be more than 6" in diameter with the majority more than 6' tall; dead wood not meeting this height requirement was considered a stump. Shrub stumps were not counted towards the total. Multi-trunk stumps were counted only once. Stumps where the tree had grown from a co-dominant trunk were counted. 




### Data analysis

Data analysis methods are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:CH3-methods-fig).


#### Bird incidence calculation {-}

Bird species incidence was defined as $incidence = \frac{\text{count of visits observed}}{8 \text{ visits}}$. I used incidence and not a repeated measures design as between site, not between year, variability is important. Incidence also reduces the influence of local species subject to population irruptions including Red Crossbill and Bushtit. Unknown species were recorded in the field but removed from analysis; unknown species accounted for only `r sum(bird.by.visit.PA.info$sweeps.present[which(bird.by.visit.PA.info$text.spp == "unknown")])` out of `r sum(bird.by.visit.PA.info$sweeps.present) ` observations (`r round(sum(bird.by.visit.PA.info$sweeps.present[which(bird.by.visit.PA.info$text.spp == "unknown")]) / sum(bird.by.visit.PA.info$sweeps.present) * 100, 3)`%).

Rare species observed fewer than two times were removed prior to calculating univariate effective species richness for all birds and bird guilds [@jost2006]. Rare species were not removed from multivariate community composition matrices [@mccune2002]. No further transformations (e.g. Wisconsin standardization) were used for multivariate analysis. The standardized search methodology controls appropriately for between-site variability making this transformation unnecessary.

#### Vegetation association preference {-}

Correlation indices were used to determine the ecological preferences of species, among a set of site groups with different conditions---here, native vs. ornamental tree and shrub community typologies identified using flexible-beta cluster analysis [@de2013; @decaceres2010]. I used a custom wrapper for the multipatt {indicspecies} implementation of the point biserial correlation coefficient to run the function 100 times and keep indicator species present in > 50% of the runs [function r.g; @decaceres2010; @indicspecies; @dysoncode]. I took the mean indicator statistic and kept those species with a mean index value > 0.5. I took this cutoff from @hinkle2003, who suggest that correlation size 0.5-0.7 is a moderate correlation; 0.7-0.9 a high correlation, and 0.9-1.0 a very high correlation. 

#### Explaining variation in effective species richness {-}

Effective species richness is defined as the exponent of Shannon entropy [@jost2006]. To assess variation in effective species richness and partition variation, I tested each independent variable in a simple univariate model using the adonis2 {vegan} PERMANOVA implementation with the Euclidian distance matrix [@vegan; @bakker2012]. Significance for all tests was assessed on pseudo-_F_ _p_-values at $\alpha \leq 0.05$. I then constructed models using all significant variables without significant betadispersion in all possible single and multiple variable model combinations. I used a custom AICc function based on Residual Sums of Squares to compare models and identify those with the best support. This sequential testing and model iteration approach reduced the need to standardize independent variables or use PCA to collapse related variables. This helped ensure interpretable results that are more relevant to urban planners and management professionals. 

For bird guild species richness, I used two of the most supported variables for the full community and percent impervious surface found significant in other studies. I used the Holm-Bonferroni method to control error rate within groups, and also calculated Spearman's correlation {stats}. 

#### Explaining variation in bird community structure {-}

I used PERMANOVA to identify variables that explain variation in bird or foraging bird community composition and NMDS for visualization [@vegan; @mccune2002]. As in univariate analysis, I tested each independent variable in a simple multivariate model using a Bray-Curtis distance matrix [@anderson2001, @vegan]. I used ANOVA to test for significant differences in categorical group dispersion using anova(betadisper()) {stats} {vegan} [@vegan]. For variables with significant pseudo-_F_ values and non-significant betadispersion, I calculated AICc using a custom function based on Residual Sums of Squares to compare all possible models using this reduced set of variables.




## Results {#CH3-results}

I observed `r ncol(matrify.incidence.clean)` species during my surveys, `r sum(descriptive.bird.bysp$foraging.num.sites > 0) ` of which were observed foraging. The number of species observed on each site varied between `r min(descriptive.bird.bysite$bird.sp.richness)` to `r max(descriptive.bird.bysite$bird.sp.richness)` species (mean `r mean(descriptive.bird.bysite$bird.sp.richness)` $\pm$ `r round(sd(descriptive.bird.bysite$bird.sp.richness),1)`), with the number of bird species observed foraging between `r min(descriptive.bird.bysite$foraging.sp.richness)` to `r max(descriptive.bird.bysite$foraging.sp.richness)` species per site (mean `r mean(descriptive.bird.bysite$foraging.sp.richness)` $\pm$ `r round(sd(descriptive.bird.bysite$foraging.sp.richness),1)`). 

The most frequently observed species included Dark-eyed Junco (`r round(16.625/20*100,1)`% of visits), American Crow (`r round(15.125/20*100,1)`% of visits), and Golden-crowned Kinglet (`r round(14.500/20*100,1)`% of visits). Common Raven, Downy Woodpecker, Hutton's Vireo, Killdeer, and Rock Pigeon were each seen only once (`r round(.125/20*100,1)`% of visits). Most bird species I observed were native; of the three non-native species encountered, only European Starling was observed with frequency (11 sites), and House Sparrow and Rock Pigeon were seen at only 1 site each. The overall prevalence of non-native species was low compared with previous research on winter urban bird communities [@clergeau1998]. Full species lists are available in [Appendix B: Birds](#CH08-birdappendix).

### Vegetation association preference {#CH3-vegetation-association}

Bird species associated with conifer forests, including Brown Creeper and Townsend's Warbler, prefer sites with native tree community clusters [@bnao]. The only bird species associated ornamental tree communities was the American Crow. The habitat preferences of birds observed foraging on site also follows this pattern (Table \@ref(tab:CH3-point-biserial)).

### Explaining variation in effective species richness

#### Effective species richness of all observed bird species {-}

The proportion of overcast survey visits, significantly explained variation in effective bird species richness. Three variables describing the outcome of development and management actions were significant after controlling for the proportion of overcast visits: presence of stands predating development, percent impervious surface on site, and median Douglas-fir height (Figure \@ref(fig:CH3-univariate-significant-plots)). The site's tree and shrub community typology identification as either native or ornamental was also significant. No neighborhood socio-economic variables, neighborhood land cover variables, or other landscaping and maintenance variables were significant; all single variable results can be found in [Appendix B: Birds](#CH07-birdappendix))

(ref:univaritesig) Three development and landscaping variables which  significantly explain variation in bird effective species richness, with ecologically meaningful effect sizes. The presence of stands predating development was associated with a greater effective species richness of approximately 7 bird species, and for every additional 10 m median Douglas-fir height effective species richness can be expected to increase approximately 3 species. Increasing percent impervious on site by 10% can be expected to decrease effective species richness by approximately 2 species

The best supported model includes proportion of overcast visits and median dominant Douglas-fir height, though the model with these variables and the presence of a stand predating development receives equal support (Table \@ref(tab:CH3-univariate-model-results)). No interaction terms were significant. The consistent inclusion of median Douglas-fir height in the best supported models suggests that this variable was particularly important for explaining variation in effective bird species richness. Variation explained for both models was approximately 75%.

#### Effective species richness of bird guilds {-}

Effective species richness of omnivores and insectivores were both positively correlated with presence of stands predating development and median Douglas-fir height (m) and negatively correlated with percent impervious on site, while grainivores were not correlated to any of these variables. Insectivores showed particularly high variation explained for stands predating development and median Douglas-fir height (Table \@ref(tab:CH3-bird-guild-esr-table)). Effective species richness of birds foraging on the ground and in trees or shrubs was positively correlated to stands predating development and median Douglas-fir height (m) though surprisingly not with percent impervious on site (adjusted _p_-value = 0.06). Only the effective species richness of conifer-associated birds was positively correlated to stands predating development and median Douglas-fir height and negatively to percent impervious on site; birds associated with mixed forests were not correlated with any variables and birds associated with open areas or without preference were correlated only weakly with median Douglas-fir height.

### Explaining variation in bird community structure

The proportion of overcast site visits was also a significant detection variable explaining variation in both the community composition of all birds observed and of foraging birds observed. After controlling for this, all significant variables for both communities represented the outcome of development, landscaping, and management actions. These variables describe  the native tree community on site (median Douglas-fir height as a proxy for tree age, the presence of stands predating development, and native conifer density, tree community cluster), the native shrub community on site (native shrub effective species richness and for foraging birds only, native shrub density), and percent impervious surface and dead wood abundance on site (see [Appendix B: Birds](#CH08-birdappendix)). None of the neighborhood- or parcel-scale socio-economic variables or neighborhood land cover variables were significant, nor were most variables describing maintenance actions (e.g. herbicide application). 

The best supported model for all bird and foraging bird community composition, as with univariate models, included the proportion of visits overcast and median dominant Douglas-fir height. Multiple other models received equal support, including single variable models with percent impervious surface on site and native conifer density, and multiple two variable models. Other two and three variable models along with all four+ variable models received substantially less support (Table \@ref(tab:CH3-incidence-AICc) and Table \@ref(tab:CH3-foraging-AICc)). The best supported models explain approximately 37-43% of variation. Median dominant Douglas-fir height and native conifer density were consistently included in models with $\Delta$ AICc $\leq$ 2.

## Discussion {#CH3-discussion}

Development and landscaping actions alter vegetation communities in social-ecological systems [@faeth2011; @avolio2018; @dysonveg2019]. I find that these outcomes of development and landscaping activities influence the presence and foraging activity of birds on office developments in Bellevue and Redmond, WA. 

### Vegetation association in urban office developments follows other habitats

The bird species with significant ecological preferences in point biserial correlation analysis support my hypothesis that urban vegetation associations and habitat use is consistent with those observed elsewhere [@bnao]. Brown Creeper and Red-breasted Nuthatch are bark foragers reliant on large conifer trees which support their prey species and provide both nesting and wintering habitat. Townsend's Warbler, Golden-crowned Kinglet, and Chestnut-backed Chickadee are canopy foragers primarily in conifer forests. Brown Creepers in particular are a species of concern due to Douglas-fir harvesting, though other species are also under pressure from land use conversion [@bnao]. Diets of Red Breasted Nuthatch and Chestnut-backed Chickadee are largely insectivorous but supplement their diets with conifer seeds [@bnao]. Only American Crow, a generalist urban species, was associated with the ornamental tree habitat cluster.

Overall, conifer associated native bird species preferred habitat on office developments characterized by native trees, including conifers. The observed bird community on office developments is similar to the bird communities observed in 'young' (40-75 y.o.) and 'mature' (105-165 y.o.) Douglas-fir stands in western Washington [@manuwal1987; @haveri2000]. These stand ages correspond with trees planted in the late 1970s following development and preserved Douglas-fir trees that established following logging in the early 1900s. 

Demonstrated use and foraging activity provide evidence that office developments provide resources important to individual fitness for winter birds, and is an important first step in establishing habitat quality, habitat selection, and effects on population size [@jones2001]. My results are consistent with other urban bird research, which found that native bird species were disproportionately associated with native vegetation [@burghardt2009; @lerman2011; @belaire2014; @mackenzie2014; @chong2014]. Additional research quantifying demography (population size, change, and age distribution) and factors influencing habitat selection (e.g. predation, food availability) are needed to definitively assess the habitat quality offered on office developments and their contribution to population size. 


### Variation in bird effective species richness and community composition

I observed very high agreement between univariate regression tests using effective species richness and multivariate tests using community composition. Both analyses identified development and landscaping variables that describe the outcome of developer and land owner decisions to preserve the tree community, resulting land cover, and the resulting tree and shrub community as significant in explaining variation after controlling for the proportion of overcast days. The best model for explaining variation in observed effective species richness and community composition included median dominant Douglas-fir height, after controlling for the proportion of overcast days. This result supports my hypothesis that variables describing the impact of development and landscaping actions on vegetation explain variation in the bird community. However, it does not support my hypothesis that univariate and multivariate analyses would reveal different patterns.




#### Response of feeding guilds {-}

Variation in bird guild effective species richness was variously explained by the three development and landscaping outcomes. Consistent with expectations, conifer associated species were negatively correlated with impervious surface on site and positively correlated with the presence of older, larger trees. This agrees with prior knowledge of birds' habitat preferences and the vegetation preference results of the point-biserial correlation coefficient analysis [@bnao]. For example, Red Crossbill is a mature conifer associated species that relies on conifer seeds to overwinter; those I observed belonged to the Pseudotsuga subgroup and were only observed foraging on Douglas-fir cones. Similarly, insectivorous bird effective species richness was negatively correlated with impervious surface on site and positively correlated with the presence of older, larger trees, consistent with other studies  [@blair2008; @zhou2012].

However, omnivorous birds also followed this pattern, which differs from other studies where birds classified as omnivores in other studies are generally urban adapted species [@chace2006; @barth2015; @clucas2015; @marzluff2016]. In addition to urban adapted species like American Crow and European Starling, omnivorous species in this study include conifer-associated natives like Red-breasted Nuthatch and Chestnut-backed Chickadee. Red-breasted Nuthatch expands its diet of arboreal arthropods to include large number of conifer seeds [@bnao]. Importantly, bird guild assignment varies based on season and location; many species have a more inclusive diet during the winter than during breeding season. For example, Audubon's Warbler is insectivorous during the breeding season, but in the winter expands its diet to include significant amounts of fruit and is thus omnivorous [@bnao]. The same bird species therefore requires different winter and summer resources, and winter and summer habitat cues are likely different [@cody1985]. 

#### Bottom-up development and landscaping variables are important {-}

Both univariate and multivariate models suggest that "bottom-up" patterns resulting from parcel-level decision making are more important than "top-down" patterns that emerge at the neighborhood-scale from diffuse decisions in determining bird community on office developments [@kinzig2005] confirming my hypothesis. Site-scale variables including plant selection also explained more variation than neighborhood-scale variables elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest [@galitsky2015] and on residential properties [@belaire2014; @daniels2006]. These site-scale variables also influence breeding bird diversity and abundance and impact foraging preference [@burghardt2009; @narango2017]. Differences in insect abundance between native and non-native shrubs are frequently identified as a causal factor [@burghardt2009; @tallamy2004; @burghardt2013]. These results suggest that for bird habitat use, social-ecological systems are heterogeneous across organizational units in such a way that small scale interactions between social and ecological spheres are more important than more diffuse patterns, at least for highly mobile species like birds. 


#### Poor support for other bottom-up variables {-}

However, bottom-up socio-economic patterns included in this analysis were not significant in explaining community variation. Most notably, parcel size was not significant here, though area consistently explained biodiversity in residential land uses and parks [@schutz2015; @beninde2015; @evans2009]. Since the species-area relationship is well established, different results may be based on different methodological choices or the relative paucity of bird species native to the Seattle area. This study was designed so that there is heterogeneity of vegetation between study units, but each study unit is relatively homogeneous. When area is important, the study unit may be internally heterogeneous, such that additional habitat types and vegetative complexity are included as area increases [@marzluff2016; @schutz2015]. 

Bottom-up patterns in maintenance inputs were also not significant in explaining measures of bird community. In other studies, irrigation was shown to increases insect prey availability and may increase the diversity of bird communities in arid areas [@schleder2010]. Here, irrigation is very common, reducing my ability to detect differences; bird foraging in the wet winter months may also be unaffected. More research on the impact of maintenance activities on bird populations and foraging activity is needed in urban areas, as these activities in agricultural areas have long been known to impact bird mortality and foraging success [@mineau2013; @lepczyk2004; @henny1972; @fry1995; @mineau1994; @mineau2002; @gibbons2015]. While pesticide and herbicide use on site did not significantly explain variation in measures of the bird community, there may be a critical exposure issues for sites with older native conifers an high bird foraging use that apply these chemicals. Particularly impacted birds would be ground and shrub foragers and insectivores associated with conifer habitat including Pacific Wren and Varied Thrush, along with sparrows and other wrens. Less impacted would be high conifer foragers if most of their prey (insect or plant) is not exposed.

#### Poor support for top-down variables {-}

Top-down neighborhood-scale socio-economic and land cover variables resulting from diffuse decisions made in socio-ecological systems did not receive support in either univariate or multivariate analyses. This result does not support my hypothesis that socio-economic variables significant in other research would be significant here. In studies of residential property, socio-economic neighborhood-scale variables significantly explained variation in bird species richness in studies of residential property [@lerman2011; @luck2013; @melles2003]. Land cover variables, including surrounding vegetation, tree canopy, and impervious surface cover were also significant [@schutz2015; @beumer2015; @vanheezik2013; @melles2003]. However, there is disagreement in the existing literature, with some studies agreeing with my results that neighborhood-scale variables are less or not important for passerine community composition [@belaire2014; @galitsky2015; @daniels2006].

Birds are highly mobile species with ranges that overlap multiple land use types. In Bellevue and Redmond, WA, commercial property is adjacent to residential land use. A bird observed on a commercial parcel also includes residential parcels in its home range. Decisions in social-ecological systems are driven by diverse agents, and decisions on commercial properties are likely driven by different motivations and preferences than residential property. For example, landscaping for self and neighborhood status on residential property versus landscaping to attract tenants on commercial property [@nassauer2009]. The outcome of different decision pathways should theoretically be important to birds only as far as they influence habitat quality. If they impact habitat quality differently, the proportion of different land uses in the area may influence bird communities. 

My results suggest that neighboring residential property habitat either doesn't matter, or is of sufficient quality to not affect passerine birds observed on office developments. It may also be that for local species habitat selection processes, the patch of habitat on the office development is more important than what surrounds it. Further behavioral ecology research and studies examining bird use of adjacent land uses is needed.

Methodological differences may partly explain the difference. Most other studies address other land uses, use neighborhoods instead of management units (parcels) as the unit of analysis, or use other bird count methods. My research also did not examine the ends of the socio-economic gradient, while others do not study the entire vegetation gradient. However, these alone can't explain differences in results, my study did agree with some studies on residential land uses using more standard methods [e.g. @belaire2014]. Standardized study designs across multiple urban areas and multiple land use types are needed to determine which factors are important in determining whether site-scale variables, neighborhood-scale variables, or both are significant. Potential explanatory variables include local bird ecology and life history, breeding vs. non-breeding season [as in @clergeau1998], patterns of development, or some combination of these.

### Study strengths and limitations

While differences in methodology makes comparison between this research and other studies more difficult, they contributed to the strengths of this study. First, sampling across the vegetation gradient within one land use allowed for detection of significant differences in tree and shrub communities and for detecting patterns of bird habitat association and important parcel-scale variables. These provide the foundation for future policy and management recommendations. Second, using the standardized search method facilitated research in noisy urban areas when birds were not calling, and kept the unit of analysis as the parcel instead of the area of a point count [@watson2003]. This allowed me to connect parcel-specific management actions with the bird community's habitat use.

There are also important limitations of this study. First, bird studies were conducted during the winter and not year round. Policy and management best practices suggestions made based on winter observations may not capture the stricter summer requirements, and more robust year round research is needed. Second, my site selection did not sample across the full range of surrounding impervious surface and parcel area. This may lead to under-valuing the importance of these variables in models of bird richness and community composition. Finally, habitat use research on its own cannot quantify habitat quality or birds' process of habitat selection without behavioral or life-history information [@sherry1985; @jones2001]. 


### Policy and management recommendations

Overall, my results suggest that bird association with a specific office development is best explained by the vegetation community structure and impervious surface cover on that specific parcel. This does not mean that policy implemented at larger scales is not important, instead my results suggest that a critical role of policy is to encourage parcel-scale decision-making and actions that support birds.  Where residents are interested in conservation, policy should alter developer and landowner actions to modify the resulting vegetation communities on site to better support local bird species populations.

My recommendations are based on patterns observed in this research on winter bird communities and in studies of breeding birds [@belaire2014; @kang2015; @shoffner2018]. Additionally, known bird habitat preference information should be used to manage for habitat used by species of interest [@bnao]. For example, if we are interested in native bird species including Brown Creeper and Townsend's Warbler, we should actively promote the native conifer habitat these species are associated with.

One practical implication of bird's relaxed winter foraging requirements is that a wider range of urban properties may be valuable in the winter. Fulfilling winter resource requirements is a crucial part of bird conservation as overwintering survival and body condition influences breeding success [@faaborg2010; @woodworth2017; @norris2004; @calvert2009].

__Tree retention:__
In the Puget Trough, human actions supporting native conifers are important for the continued presence of native forest species including Brown Creeper, Varied Thrush, and Pacific Wren. Established trees provide critical opportunities for foraging, nesting, and perching, and are more beneficial than newly planted replacement trees [@barth2015; @sung2012]. Minimizing the loss of conifer trees to the maximum extent practicable is supported both by this work and others [@barth2015; @stagoll2010; @shryock2017; @shoffner2018]. Key exceptions are if a site is extensively infected with a root rot (e.g. _Phellinus sulphurascens_, _Heterobasidion_ sp.) or if existing trees are otherwise compromised.

Ideally, city policy would encourage development that avoids "green land" disturbance, and designs that preserve as many trees and as much native soil as possible while also fulfilling client needs. Other researchers' priorities mirror these; they suggest minimizing forest loss first, then reducing disturbance effects in the matrix [@shoffner2018]. Existing tree protection policies are limited by local politics and developer and landowner compliance, and the efficacy of existing policy is mixed [@sung2012; @hill2009]. Other city policies, including parking space requirements and parking lot planting requirements, result in development patterns that favor small cultivated trees over native conifer retention and planting. These policies will need to be changed to better support bird use of sites.

__Planting trees:__
Additionally, actions and policies that accomplish long-term urban forest management---particularly planning for succession---will be critical to the future of urban birds in the Puget Trough and elsewhere [@threlfall2016]. In addition to aligning policy to support native tree planting, outreach and initiatives encouraging larger native tree planting may be necessary to overcome the observed bias towards planting smaller ornamental deciduous trees [@tenneson2014]. While some ornamental non-native trees like seed-bearing _Fraxinus_ sp. may selectively provide important food resources, the inclusion of native conifer variables in well supported models and the results of other research studies suggests that native trees are more important [@schlaepfer2011; @narango2017]. Far more native bird species are associated with the native tree habitat community typology than the ornamental tree habitat community typology, suggesting that planting natives will not negatively impact local bird species, but if these actions are not taken, species could be materially hurt. 

While very young trees provide little habitat value [@sung2012], trees should become more valuable over time as they mature. For example, older neighborhoods with more mature cultivated vegetation supported higher bird diversity than newly developed neighborhoods [@white2005streets], and birds prefer foraging in native trees and that these trees support higher prey abundance [@narango2017]. Planting trees also anticipates existing tree death to maintain the future of the urban forest, as planting largely replaces tree dispersion and establishment processes on landscaped properties [@ettinger2017]. 

__Planting shrubs:__
Planting native shrubs is suggested as a straightforward action to provide food resources to native birds as shrubs are easily planted, grow quickly relative to trees, and provide cover and foraging resources [@cerra2016]. Other studies have found that increasing the volume or complexity of understory vegetation increases urban bird species richness [@threlfall2016]. However, landscaping changes on commercial developments (0.5-5 acres) can be expensive; based on anecdotal evidence these changes are outside of the budget for many of the properties in my sample. Additional research on high native shrub richness sites, including post-installation monitoring, is needed specifically in commercial landscapes to evaluate the cost/benefit of shrub community shifts for birds, insects, and other urban wildlife. For example, Varied Thrush often chooses areas with less shrub cover when foraging [@beck2000].

__Other plantings:__
Further, conifer forests are not the only type of habitat historically found in the Puget Trough. Landscaping on office developments imitating grasslands, young forests, or other ecosystems could provide important resources for native bird species and other wildlife while offering design alternatives for developers and landowners when there is no existing forest or retaining trees on site is not feasible. An important question for future research is whether such designs provide resources for desired bird species and other wildlife. Note that this is almost entirely unexplored. During my vegetation classification visits to 400+ properties in Bellevue and Redmond, no property was landscaped in this fashion. Two key limitations likely exist. First, the aesthetics of grasslands are frequently challenging [@hands2002]. Second, current policy may preclude these alternative native habitats, necessitating municipalities to grant waivers or alter landscaping codes before they can be tested.

  

Overall, changing developer and landowner actions and preferences is likely the only way to sustainably alter development patterns, and there are strong arguments for ecologists' involvement in the development process [@niemela1999; @felson2013; @miller2002]. In addition to outreach for developers and landowners on the importance of trees both to potential clients [@kaplan2007; @lottrup2012; @nesbitt2017] and wildlife [this paper; @barth2015; @stagoll2010; @shryock2017], joint research with developers to identify building techniques that are both cost effective and conserve birds are essential. Meaningful sustainability must include a fundamental shift in how sites are developed---moving from a 'tabula rasa' approach where sites are cleared of vegetation and topsoil prior to development to a more place-based and site-specific design and engineering approach.


## Conclusion

Parcel-scale development and landscaping actions, including tree removal and planting species selection, directly and indirectly alter vegetation communities and create variation in the vegetation communities on commercial land use [@dysonveg2019]. I found that conifer-associated bird species exhibited clear associations with office developments where native trees were preserved through development and planted during site landscaping. Measures of bird effective species richness and community composition were significantly explained by variables describing the age and density of native conifers, the abundance of native shrubs, and the amount of impervious surface present at the office development. These results provide support for human-mediated changes in vegetation affecting higher trophic levels on office developments in Redmond and Bellevue, WA [@faeth2011]. 

My results contribute to our understanding of how human actions at the parcel-scale correlate with bird community composition on commercial land uses, and can help guide policy and management best practices. Evidence that developer and landowner vegetation choices impact bird richness and community composition suggest that actions and policies that accomplish native conifer preservation and the long-term management of the urban forest will be critical to the future of native birds that overwinter in the Puget Trough. These site-scale actions together contribute to the habitat provided by the urban matrix, and increasing habitat quality in the urban matrix contributes to breeding bird success and may reduce the probability of local extinction [@rosenzweig2003; @shoffner2018]. There is a significant role for developers, landowners, and policy makers to shape this future. Specific recommendations for the Puget Trough arising from this research include maximizing preservation of existing native canopy cover during development---including designing buildings to preserve trees and soils and avoiding 'green' development---and landscaping with native conifers. 

Future research efforts should center on developing building techniques that are both cost effective and foster bird conservation, as changing developer and landowner actions and preferences is critical to sustainably and meaningfully altering development patterns. Where native conifers cannot be preserved or have already been lost, researchers should explore the value to local bird species of planting native conifer and deciduous trees and of alternative native habitats, including grasslands and shrublands mimicking newly disturbed/early successional habitat. Post-installation monitoring to determine the efficacy of suggested approaches is critical, though often ignored, and can also discover unintended consequences including elevated bird-window strike rates [@hostetler2011; @hager2017]. Finally, birds move across the landscape and have ranges overlapping multiple land use types. More comprehensive research on bird habitat associations and different land uses that relates management units (parcels) to bird presence is needed. More in depth studies of bird behavior and population biology including tracking their movements across cities is needed to better understand how the complex patterns that emerge in social-ecological systems impact bird habitat use.
